List needs review. Unordered. RobW.

- look at all commands together (showref, listub, cons)

- overide help command. Perhaps just print __doc__ if it starts with '!' or '@command'

- error handling in wrapper. check TypeError depth. Give help inside exception string.

- parameter scannables should return current virtual angle __str__ would also show requestd

- remove need for axis_par scannables - set value, consider e.g. mu scan, and moved from epics. mu scan requires mu to be same level as hkl to work efficiently

- implement mu_eq_nu mode

- add eta_half_delta and mu_half_nu modes

- provide fivec etc plugins (i13 first)

- provide arbitrary virtual names (and check arbitray motor names work)

- provide short cut mode access my number (beamline specific) ? Good idea?

- handle eV / keV properly (wavelength internally, flag to energy_unit equal 'keV' (default) or 'eV'

- Fix .__doc__ help on hkl (metaclass syetm fails under Jython with a java base class)
